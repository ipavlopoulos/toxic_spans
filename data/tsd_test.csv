Coats’ predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump’s comments “a terrible, insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”

That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.

Question for Mr. Clark, why is our government passing *ANY* piece of legislation that singles out a single religion?  Canada already has enshrined, in our Constitution, religious freedom as well as protection from discrimination based on religion.  We already have anti-hate laws and even terrorism laws to protect against religious persecution by individuals.

This is a pointless piece of legislation that will, at best, result in a waste of money.  All we need to do is enforce laws that are already on the books."
